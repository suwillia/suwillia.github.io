Tracking bacteria found in the belly button

This module challenges us to build an interactive dashboard that provides a drop down that shows the datatset for each name id selected. We also then built a bar chart and a bubble chart that shows graphically the top ten bacteria cultures found in a belly button. The skills required html, d3 and javascript to combine the data. Additional help was given by using the resource pages found at https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/ as well as Dr. A's walk through module video. One modification we had to due was to set maximum marker size for datasets that were too small to show on the bubble chart. While the samples json was available I used the url location as my data source instead, found at https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json
